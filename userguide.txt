To run Eco3M-CarbOx:

        make !two executable will be created : eco3M_ini.exe and eco3M.exe

    - the file config.ini allow to define: the time, time step, and save time of simulation variables biogeochemical process
    - Results files are stocked in "SORTIES" directory
    - Boundary conditions and forcings data are stocked in "DATA" directory
    - All subroutines of biogeochemical processes are stocked in "F_PROCESS" directory
