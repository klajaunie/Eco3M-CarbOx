USER GUIDE

The exact version of the Eco3M-CarbOx code used in the precited study can be be run as following:

make !two executable files will be created : eco3M_ini.exe and eco3M.exe

- the file config.ini allows to define: the time, time step, and save time of simulation variables biogeochemical process
- Results files are stocked in "SORTIES" directory
- Boundary conditions and forcings data are stocked in "DATA" directory
- All subroutines of biogeochemical processes are stocked in "F_PROCESS" directory
